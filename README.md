<h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
This project seeks to:

<ol>
    <li>
      Critically evaluate the capabilities of different visualisation tools, both proprietary, such as
SAS, and open source, to support the discovery and display of critical and valuable answers
hidden in small, medium, and large data. 
    </li>

  <li>
    Execute analysis and visualisation using realistic data sources from disparate disciplines and
the most appropriate visualisation tools to identify valuable questions and develop welljustified, actionable answers.
  </li>

  <li>
  Critically evaluate and apply ethical principles and standards to the whole of the
visualisation process.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Project Task</h2>
The aim of this project is to interrogate a dataset using a range of visualisations that demonstrate understanding of the
large complex data set. The workload is split into three parts of increasing complexity.

<h4>Part 1- Understand the Dataset and Descriptive Visualization</h4>
Based on the data set representing crime data in regions across Derbyshire. In this part of the work:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
Produce a short narrative that describes the data set, what fields it contains and some initial
observations of its usefulness.
  </li>

  <li>
    Using the R software package, read the data into a data frame and produce a table of
summary statistics and relevant plots to visually inspect the data for the year 2019.
     <ol> <li>
    Comment on any changes you have made to the data (e.g., data transforms, or
dealing with zero values)
    </li></ol>
  </li>
</ol> 

<h4>Part 2 – Explore Relationships in the data set</h4>
This second part deals with the evaluation of relationships between variables within the
data set provided and production of appropriate visualisations to illustrate one's evaluation. Using known
techniques:

<ol type="a">
<li>
  Using a simple linear regression, produce appropriate visualisations that allow you to check
for constant variance, independence, and normality distributions. Do these assumptions
hold for your model?
</li>

<li>
  Compute residuals for each model in Task 2 (a) and store them in a separate data frame
called e.g., residuals. Produce scatterplots and a heatmap to visually investigate the
correlation between all columns of residuals. Comment on these plots.
</li>

  <li>
    Use hierarchical clustering to organise your residuals and look for groupings. Present your
results graphically (e.g., dendrograms). Identify, if any, observations that are considered
outliers.
  </li>
</ol> 

<h4>Part 3 – Independent Evaluation and Commentary</h4>
This final part entails visually interrogating the data using techniques of one's choosing. One could,
for example, create maps of the region (shapefiles have been provided).

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Interrogate the data and analysis to determine the meaning behind the data. You should
produce coherent findings that are justified through visualisation.
  </li>

  <li>
    Provide some commentary on the ethics of analysis and what steps should be taken to avoid
misleading analysis and visualisation.
  </li>
</ol>
